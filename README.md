After downloading:
npm i (to install the project)
In a separate terminal window start the chomedriver - ./startChromedriver.sh 77 would start it for Chrome 77 (check your version of Chrome)
grunt votePlayer (to run the example test - you might need to install grunt, which is just npm install grunt)
